HLstatsZ: Work in-progress to modernized HLstatsX (but not too much) for source and source2 game engine.<br>
Admin panel is missing for now. Use HLstatsx to manage your servers.<br>
Tested with PHP 8.4<br>
HLstatsZ uses these scripts:<br>
&nbsp;DataTables<br>
&nbsp;ApexChartS<br>
&nbsp;OpenStreetMap(leaflet)<br>

Plugin for HLX to properly works with CS2:<br>
https://github.com/daffyyyy/CS2-SimpleAdmin (Use of css_cssay to print)<br>
https://github.com/startersclan/source-udp-forwarder (logs)<br>
And set Hlstatsx mod to CSS (instead of SOURCEMOD)<br>

Test in game and see it here:<br>
